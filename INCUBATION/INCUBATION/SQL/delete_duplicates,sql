delete from table t1 inner join table t2
where t1.id > t2.id
and t1.col_name = t2.col_name(name of col(s) which is(are) duplicate(s))

BETTER SOLUTION

WITH duplicates as 
(select *, row_number() OVER(order by id) as rn from table)

delete from table where id in (select id from duplicates where rn >1)
